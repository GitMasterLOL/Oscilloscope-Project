# v0.1.0 Scrap Laptop charger

## Version Info
**Date:** 2025-04-24

**Status:** Obsolete, superceded in v0.1.0-custom-smps

---

## Overview
This is the first prototype which uses an old, discarded laptop charger to quickly test the form factor without investing time in CAD modelling or fabrication

---

## Advantages
- Wide range of sizes
- Inbuilt power adapter
- Easier to modify and use

---

## Limitations
- Costlier than the compnent parts
- Uses Linear transformer type regulator:
  - Low power efficiency
  - Power is lost as heat

---

## Lessons learnt
- Learnt about differenty types of power adapters & regulators
- Found that SMPS is a better option
- Found that it is better to design a custom SMPS for better power efficiency and smooth power lines
