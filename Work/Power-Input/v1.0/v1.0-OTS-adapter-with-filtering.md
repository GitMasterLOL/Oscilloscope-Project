# v1.0 Off the Shelf Adapter with Filtering

## **Date:** 2025-06-08

## **Status:** In Progress

---

## Summary

Initial concept for a power adapter module to convert AC mains input into regulated ±15v and 5v DC rails suitable for internal electronics (MCU, sensors, op-amps, etc.)

This design uses an off the shelf 5v power adapter for simplicity, and plans to filter and scale the output to the required voltage rails (GND, 5v, -15v, +15v)

## Input/Output Specifications

| Parameter         | Value                          |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Input Voltage     | 100–240V 50,60Hz AC (from wall)|
| Adapter Output    | 5V noisy DC (from ots adapter) |
| Desired Rails     | 5V, ±15V                       |
| Max Load Current  | TBD based on subsystems        |
| Isolation         | Isolated (adapter handles isolation) |

## System Design Overview

- **Input Source:** Off-the-shelf 5V power adapter
- **Power Conversion:** Use LDOs and ICs to step up to required voltages
- **Modules:** 
  - noisy 5v → clean 5v (filter)
  - 5V → 15V (IC)
  - 15V → ±15V (LDO)
- **Protection:** Input fuse, transient protection (TVS), reverse polarity diodes

## Testing Plan

- Measure ripple and noise on each output rail
- Check thermal performance under continuous load
- Verify short-circuit protection response
- Load-test each rail individually and in combination
