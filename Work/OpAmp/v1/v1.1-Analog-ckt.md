## Proposed Circuit Elements

| Component         | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Voltage Divider   | Roughly scales the ±12V signal down to a fifth and inverts it     |
| Inverter  | Invaerts the signal and pulls the lower offset closer to 0V |

## Summary

- Designed the PCB in KiCad using AD8610xR ICs
- The circuit takes a +12V to -12V signal and maps it down to 3.3V to 0 by:
  1. Scaling and inverting the signal from [+12,-12] to [0.270,3.27]
  2. Scaling and Inverting the signal from [0.270,3.27] to [3.03,0.031]
- Hence the signal is mapped from [+12,-12] to [3.03,0.031] which can be accurately read by the microcontroller

## Testing Plan

- Simulate with ±12V sine and square inputs
- Check linearity and clipping
- Confirm final voltage always stays within 0–3.3V

---

## Next Steps

- Include a clamping circuit to limit the output voltage to 3.3V
- Consider integrating into the power adapter PCB
